Module: We can use functions and closure to make modules. A module is a function or object that presents an interface
but that hides its state and implementation. By using functions to produce modules, we can almost completely
eliminate our use of global variables, thereby mitigating one of JavaScript's worst features.

In classical languages, objects are instances of classes, and a class can inherit from another class. JavaScript is
a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects.
