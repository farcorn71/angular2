New features in ES6 are: Object Literals, Blocking Scope, Let const  for ...of loop, Spreading and rest.  
use strict - for enforcing variable declaration, strict mode, you cannot use undeclared variables

When using an arrow function, you will not be able to use *bind*, *call* and *apply*
unlike ES5, es6 does not have access to the prototype when using arrow function 
for default parameters, if we pass in "undefined" as an argument, javascript will take the specified value instead.

Spread and rest.
Rest works like sting generics in Java e.g string ...


Destructuring: take out the elements of an array or an object.

Interpolation can be used in template literals with symbol ${}
